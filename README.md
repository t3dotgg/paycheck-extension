# PayCheck for X

tl;dr - I made an extension that (poorly) estimates how much money a post is worth

# HOW TO INSTALL

1. Download latest .zip from [releases](https://github.com/t3dotgg/paycheck-extension/releases)
2. Unzip the file
3. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in your browser
4. Enable developer mode
5. Click "Load unpacked"
6. Select the folder you unzipped
7. Copilot wrote these instructions for me so I hope they're good enough
